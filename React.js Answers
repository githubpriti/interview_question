1. React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces1. It’s primarily used in web development, but can also be 
used in mobile app development with React Native, and in desktop app development with Electron2.

Key features of React include:
1.JSX: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It’s an XML/HTML-like syntax extension to JavaScript1. It allows you to write HTML elements in 
JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods1.
2.Components: React is component-based. You build up complete applications using components like forms, buttons, etc. These components are 
reusable, which means you can use one component for every similar element on your site2.
3.React DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. The ReactDOM.render() method is used to render HTML elements1.
4.State Management: Components in React can manage their own state and communicate that state to child components2.

2. React.js offers several advantages for building web applications:

1.Simplified Scripting: React.js features a free syntax extension called JSX, which allows you to write HTML markup within JavaScript1.
2.Component-based Architecture: React.js uses a modular design, allowing you to create reusable components1.
3.Faster Rendering: React.js accelerates UI development with shortcut paths and reusable UI components1.
4.Stable Code: React.js guarantees stable code2.
5.SEO Friendly: React.js is SEO friendly, making it easier for developers to find the right content for the user2.
6.Strong Community Support: React.js is backed by a strong community of skilled developers and companies2.
7.Cross-Platform Development: With React Native, you can build cross-platform apps3.
8.Efficient and Easy to Learn: React.js is known to be fast, efficient, and easy to learn2.
9.Vast Library of Developer Tools: React.js has a vast library of developer tools, improving the user experience and allowing seamless 
integration into existing applications4

3. While React.js is a powerful library for building user interfaces, it does have some limitations:

1.Lack of Proper Documentation: React technologies are updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to document it or write 
proper instructions1.
2.Development Speed: The constant evolution of React might be perceived as negative by some developers due to the need for constant 
relearning of processes or new mechanics1.
3.JSX Complexity: JSX, a JavaScript extension that makes the code more readable and clean, might cause confusion to those who are not 
much familiar with it1.
4.Problems With SEO: There have been concerns that Google used to have problems with indexing dynamic websites with client-side 
rendering1.
5.It’s a Library, Not a Framework: While the flexible nature of React reduces uniformity, it only covers the UI components, nothing else.
Developers spend more time configuring supportive tools2.
6.It Uses JSX: JSX allows you to use a mixture of HTML and JavaScript to write code in components. This is an entirely new concept that
many developers are not familiar with2.
7.Does Not Support SEO: React, by design, was not built with SEO in mind. Therefore, Google does not automatically index apps created 
with the library2.

4. JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It was developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) and is 
primarily used in React.js12. Here are some key points about JSX:
-It allows developers to write HTML-like code inside a JavaScript file2.
-JSX makes it easier to create reusable UI components with fewer lines of code in a template-type language with the power of JavaScript1.
-It helps us to write HTML in JavaScript and forms the basis of React Development1.
-Using JSX is not compulsory but it is highly recommended for programming in React as it makes the development process easier as the code
becomes easy to write and read1.
-JSX creates an element in React that gets rendered in the UI. It is transformed into JavaScript functions by the compiler at runtime1.
-Error handling and warnings become easier to handle when using JSX1.

5. There are several ways to create a new React application:

1.Using Create React App (CRA): This is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build
setup with no configuration1. Here’s how you can do it:
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

-Replace “my-app” with the desired name for your project1.

2.Using npm init:
npm init react-app my-app

-This method is available in npm 6+1.

3.Using Yarn:
yarn create react-app my-app

-This method is available in Yarn 0.25+1.

6. NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for JavaScript’s runtime Node.js12. Here are some key points about NPM:

-It’s a library and registry for JavaScript software packages3.
-NPM also has command-line tools to help you install different packages and manage their dependencies3.
-It allows developers to share and install useful packages1.
-NPM is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs4.
-It puts modules in place so that Node.js can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently4.
-It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases4.
-0All NPM packages are defined in files called package.json. The content of package.json must be written in JSON2.
NPM can manage dependencies2.
You can download all NPM public software packages without any registration or logon2.
NPM is free to use2.
Here’s an example of how to install a package using NPM:

npm install <package>

Replace <package> with the name of the package you want to install2.
